1) Copy the folder structure and create all .java files.
2) Create the jar, such that the folder structure is preserved [TODO: understand this better and explain in more detail].
   This can be accomplished by opening a terminal in the /java/ folder and executing:
   > javac a/b/c/E_jar.java 
   > jar cf somejar.jar a/b/c/E_jar.class 
   As a result, somejar.jar should be created in /java/.
3) Compile the main class C_pck.java.
   This class uses multiple 'roots' and an external jar; it can be compiled as follows:
   NOTE: using ~/ instead of /home/joris/ does NOT WORK for classpaths after ':'!
   > javac -cp /home/joris/Desktop/java/root1:/home/joris/Desktop/java/root2:/home/joris/Desktop/java/somejar.jar ~/Desktop/java/root1/dir2/C_pck.java
4) Run the main method:
   > java -cp /home/joris/Desktop/java/root1:/home/joris/Desktop/java/root2:/home/joris/Desktop/java/somejar.jar dir2.C_pck
